# AI-Pictionary

***Project Description:***
 This project was originally made for NWPlus's NWHacks Hackathon in collaboration with *JYangCS2004* and *epcvan*

AI Pictionary Game is an engaging single-player web-based game where players test their creativity and deduction skills by guessing unique images generated by the DALL-E 3 engine from a giant list of possible prompts. Each round presents the player with a unique image produced by the AI, and the player must accurately guess what it represents.

 Additionally, users have the option to toggle the quality of the photos and their size in the backend if they desire.
